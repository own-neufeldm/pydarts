# pydarts

This is a python app for tracking the score of a Darts game.

## Type Hinting

Required when:

* a function argument is declared
* a function returns or yields a value, even `None`
* a variable is initialized with `None`
* a `list` variable is initialized with `[]`

Recommended when:

* a variable type cannot be auto-evaluated by VS Code

For simplicity and readability, type hinting should be omitted everywhere else.

Thank you.

## Usage

PyDarts was developed on Windows and not tested on other platforms, though in theory everything
should work just as well. If you are on Windows, simply go to the latest release and download the
zip file for your system, e.g. `PyDarts_Windows_x64.zip`. On all other platforms, you have to clone
this repository and install from source code, e.g. by creating a virtual environment and installing
the application in it.

Have fun!

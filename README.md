# pydarts

This is a Python app for tracking the score of a Darts game.

## Requirements

This application requires Python v3.11 (or higher) to be installed. It was developed on and for
Windows (x64), though other common operating systems are probably supported too (not tested).

## Setup

Assuming your environment meets the requirements stated above, install like so on Windows:

1. clone this repository and `cd` into it
2. create a virtual environment (venv): `python -m venv .\.venv`
3. activate the virtual environment: `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
4. install pydarts in the virtual environment: `pip install -e .`
5. create an executable: `pyinstaller .\pydarts.spec`

You now have a portable executable at `.\dist\pydarts.exe` which you can move and run.
